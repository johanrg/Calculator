The Calculator Project
======================

The goal of this program is to learn more about Java. It's not about making anything smart, usefull or
anything like that. I bet there are plenty of things I could have done better if I knew more about
Java, but I don't, hence why I'm making this program.

###So what will it do once it's done?
It will be able to calculate expressions like 10 + 2 * (3 / 2), from within a simple JavaFX GUI. Perhaps I'll
take it further but we'll see.

###Is it crap?
Wouldn't surprise me one bit, I started with Java 2 days ago so I expect it to be a learning experience.

###Goals
Learn about JavaFX and GUI development in Java, while working with classes, collections and strings etc.
